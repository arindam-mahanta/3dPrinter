Hi Arindam, 

can you print this buckle for my SUP backpack? The original one is literally bullshit, doesnt click at all.
Can you print the male connector with full infill? For the female I think it should be sufficient to have it at 80% or 
something, whatever fits best after slicing.

I need the "schnalle40" 2 times, everything else once.

Thanks in advance, 

Greeting Fabian
